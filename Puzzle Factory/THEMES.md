## Notes

- When adding new puzzles, update both the "Puzzles by Date" section and the appropriate difficulty tier section
- Normalized pairs help catch variations (e.g., "Fruits | Red Things" vs "Red Things | Fruits")
- If a category pair is too similar to an existing one, it should be rejected (e.g., "Fruits | Red Fruits" is too similar to "Fruits | Red Things")
- Words containing 'EAR' | Body Parts
