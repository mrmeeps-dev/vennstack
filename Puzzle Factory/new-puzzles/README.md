# New Puzzles Directory

Place puzzle JSON files generated by AI in this directory, then run the import script to move them to the main puzzle storage.

## Usage

1. Generate puzzles using AI (see `AI_GENERATION_PROMPT.md`)
2. Save the JSON output to files in this directory
3. Run the import script:
   ```bash
   node ../import-puzzles.js
   ```

The script will:
- Validate each puzzle
- Move it to `src/data/` with the filename `{puzzle-id}.json`
- Update `THEMES.md` with the new category pairs
- Warn about duplicates if found

## File Naming

You can name the files anything (e.g., `puzzle1.json`, `monday-puzzle.json`), but the script will use the `id` field from the JSON to determine the final filename.
